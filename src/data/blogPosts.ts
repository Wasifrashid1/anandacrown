    readTime: '5 min read',
    content: `The 3+1 BHK configuration has become the most sought-after apartment layout in Mohali's premium residential market in 2026. Here are five reasons driving this trend.

3 BHK in Mohali

The traditional 3 BHK has always been popular among families in Mohali. It offers the right balance of space, affordability, and functionality. However, evolving lifestyle needs — including work-from-home requirements, dedicated study rooms, and guest accommodation — have pushed buyers toward the 3+1 BHK variant.

In Mohali's residential market, 3 BHK apartments remain the highest-demand configuration, accounting for a significant portion of luxury project bookings. The addition of the extra room transforms a standard apartment into a versatile living space.

Projects like Ananda Crown in Sector 78 have recognized this demand shift, offering thoughtfully designed 3+1 BHK layouts that cater to modern family requirements.

3+1 BHK floor plans

The key advantage of 3+1 BHK floor plans is the additional multipurpose room. This space can serve as a home office, library, meditation room, guest bedroom, or children's study area — adapting to the family's changing needs over time.

Well-designed 3+1 BHK floor plans prioritize natural light, ventilation, and privacy. The extra room is typically positioned to function independently without disrupting the main living areas.

At Ananda Crown, the 3+1 BHK floor plans are engineered to maximize usable area while maintaining premium finishes and spacious layouts that define luxury living.

spacious apartments Mohali

Spaciousness has become a defining factor for premium apartment buyers in Mohali. Post-2020 lifestyle changes have made families prioritize larger living spaces with room for multiple activities.

Mohali offers a unique advantage — premium apartments here provide significantly more space per rupee compared to Chandigarh or metro cities. This value proposition, combined with modern amenities and planned infrastructure, makes spacious apartments in Mohali an attractive option.

The trend toward 3+1 BHK apartments reflects a broader shift in buyer preferences — from compact efficient units to generous layouts that support comfortable, multi-functional family living.`
